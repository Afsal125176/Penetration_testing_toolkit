Here’s a simple, practical `requirements.txt` for the toolkit (keeps the core dependency minimal plus a couple of niceties):

```
requests>=2.28.0
tqdm>=4.65.0
colorama>=0.4.6
```

* `requests` — used by the brute-forcer for HTTP requests.
* `tqdm` — optional progress bars for long operations (wordlist brute force, scanning).
* `colorama` — optional cross-platform colored terminal output.

Save this into your project root as `requirements.txt`, then install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
